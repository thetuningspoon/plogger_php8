# plogger_php8
A simple php7-based web gallery that can be integrated into your website. This fork is based on the fork by wuffleton which uses PDO as the database backend instead of the depreciated mysql library. This includes support for mysql and pgsql out of the box. I've updated and altered all the code so it will run on PHP 8.0.
